# DAOS Reproducibility

This repository supports the reproducibility initatives of the HPC and AI community
by providing a persistent location to consistently document DAOS system configurations,
tuning paramters, and execution environments for DAOS-related benchmarks.

Refer to the main [DAOS repository](https://github.com/daos-stack/daos)
